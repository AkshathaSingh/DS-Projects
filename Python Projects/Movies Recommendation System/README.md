## Movies Recomendation System with Movie Tweetings Data
### Overview
In this project we will build a **Knowledge Based Recommendation System** to recommend movies to our users using the MovieTweetings 
Dataset.

We will be doing the following steps to implement this project:
- We'll collect the two datasets required, the Movies data and the Reviews data
- We'll do a preliminary descriptive analysis to understand our data.
- we'll the clean our data by handling missing values and extracting relevant features.
- We'll build a function to create a Knowledge based Recommendation System, which would return top ranked items as 
  recommendations with specified filters.

This project has been done as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.
