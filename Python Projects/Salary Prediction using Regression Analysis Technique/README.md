## Salary estimation and prediction using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor

#### Overview
In this project, we'll estimate the value of Annual Salary of each customer from the data available and build a prediction model
to predict the Annual Salary of customers of a Financial Services Company.

We'll be doing the following steps to implement this project:
- we'll collect the data
- we'll preprocess the data by removing the missing values, handling outliers and calculating new features
- we'll then create a dataframe with all the relevant features and spilt it into a train set and test set
- we'll then fit our data to our prediction models Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regerssor and predict the values

#### Data
- This project has been done as a part of the ANZ Virtual Internship Program and the data was provided by them.
