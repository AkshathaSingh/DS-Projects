## The Disaster Response Pipeline Project
### Overview
This project was done as a part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program in collaboartion with Figure Eight. The aim of the project is to build a model for an API that would classify the disaster resposne messages into categories using Natural Language Proeessing and Machine Learning and return the results in real time. The model is built using the data engineering techniques and the data has been taken from Figure Eight.

The project is divided into three main components, the ETL Pipeline, ML Pipeline and the Web app:

### 1. ETL Pipeline
