## Recommendations with IBM
### Overview
In this project we will build Recommendation Systems using **Rank Based recommendations, User_User Collaborative filtering, and Matrix 
Factorization** methods to recommend articles to the users of the IBM Watson Studio platform.

We will be doing the following steps to implement this project:

- We'll collect the two datasets required, the Users data and the articles data.
- We'll do the preliminary descriptive analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis to understand our data.
- we'll the clean our data by handling missing values and extracting relevant features.
- We'll then build functions to create Recommendation Systems using all three methods.
- we'll then evaluate the performance of our recommendation system.

This project has been done as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.
